Project_Euler_Answers
=====================
I created this repo to post all of my Project Euler answers.
I started playing around with the problems to increase my knowledge of ruby 
and get familiar with methods and gems that are powerful, 
but not often talked about in introductory ruby courses on codecademy or
other coding learn apps.

My process was:
1. Solve the problem naively, breaking each step down.
2. Search out methods for help
3. Refactor the code
4. Check my answers against others' to look for cleaner and faster ways of solving the problems.

I started these before I started at Makersquare. My comments in the file were more for my benefit to structure out the logic.

[I also did many of these in Javascript here](https://www.github.com/allizad/Project-Euler-Javascript)
